Hello Team, <br>
          i would like to introduce sam performances then attracted fellow French side Paris Saint-Germain, <br>
and he was the subject of the second most expensive association football transfer, as well as the <br>
Most for a teenager, when he moved to the club in a transfer. <br>
The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. <br>
Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and <br>
he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years <br>
coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him.\n <br>
Regards, <br>
Sam <br>

Hope this finds you well! Iâ€™m reaching out today to introduce my colleague Samantha Billings, <br>
who recently moved to the club in a transfer. <br>

Regards, <br>
Sam <br>
